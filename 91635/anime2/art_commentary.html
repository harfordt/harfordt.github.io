            <p><i>"Showing or explaining each stage in a process"</i>
                <br>
                <br>For some of my artworks I like to show the step-by-step process for those who are curious as to how I draw digitally. What's the first step that I do, what's the last step, how did the result end up like so? Step-by-steps raise various questions that I hope to answer via showing my watchers the process of the creation, whilst doing my best to explain the details.
                <br>
                <br>Below, you can find four different step-by-step processes which I've drawn! By clicking each image, you will see the commentary notes in the caption. I hope this helps~

                        <a class="image-set" href="images/gallery/stepbystep/step_gx.jpg" data-lightbox="gx10th" data-title="YGO GX 10th Anniversary <br>1. Sketch: The sketch is always the first thing every artist does in order to get a clear idea in their head of what they're drawing. When sketching, I generally like to use light colours that match the character. <br>2. Line Art: Next comes the line art; it's a boring process of drawing neat lines over your sketch. Boring and tedious as it may sound, sometimes it's not always the colour that judges an art work's final result - the line art can also make an art piece look good. Even if it's only a matter of lining, each artist has a different style of line arting, so I encourage you to find your own! ;D <br>3. Greyscale: <i>THIS STEP MAY BE SKIPPED.</i> To be honest, the greyscale step is completely unnecessary. I only had this step because I originally was going to leave this art piece like this. I didn't have any intention to work on it any further, but then I changed my mind and decided to colour it fully. <br>4. Base Colours: Base colours are fairly easy to do - especially when you use the 'fill bucket' tool. I tend to use it as it makes life easier; afterwards you simply need to fill in the spots that the fill bucket missed. <br>5. Detailed Colour: Some people tend to find this part difficult as they need to think about light source. I had this trouble at the start too, but sometimes it's not about <i>thinking</i> where the light source is, but sometimes it's whether you can actually <i>see</i> it yourself. Where do you imagine it will be, where do you think the shading looks right? It's all up to you. <br>6. Background: I literally just threw on a 'free to use material' texture on the background for this. You can either draw your own or use a free one! Try to avoid using a copyrighted background or one that clearly says 'do not use'~ <br>7. Finished: Not really a step, but here's the final result, yay! Let's hope you can make awesome art too!!"><img src="images/gallery/stepbystep/step_gx_thumb.jpg"></a>

Sketch: A quick sketch of the characters and position. <br>2. Line art: As this is an old work, in the past I didn't have proper pressure sensitivity in the pen for the tablet, so for this I used the 'line work' tool. In order to line the whole thing, I dragged a bunch of different straight lines whilst curving them at the appropriate places. (Honestly, it was a very painful process; moral of the story - absolutely have pen pressure sensitivity!) <br>3. Base Colours: Again, the bucket tool for filling the colour. Others like to use the magic wand, but I prefer bucket as I personally think it's easier. But feel free to fill it whichever way you want~ <br>4. Detail Colour: In the past, I didn't really care about light source too much, so with this drawing I pretty much just shaded anywhere I felt should have shade. Same goes for adding light to the colour. <br>5. Clipping Line Art: In this step, although a bit hard to see, I 'clip' the line art to a suitable colour. 'clip' is when you clip a layer to another layer to apply effects or colours to the clipped layer without tampering with the original. The 'clipping function' is a huge help to artists, and I definitely recommend using it. The reason why I clip the line art is so rather than just having plain black line art that stands out, I take darker shades based on the base colours and clip it onto the black. This way, it gives a somewhat softer feel to the art piece than bold black lines. <br>6. BG & Font: Threw a background onto this art work and typed in the font using MS Paint as I had no better program to put font onto a drawing at the time.

Being able to use the sketch as a basis is effective for drawing. When sketching certain characters, I usually use a colour that represents the character, in this case I used red. For sketching, I use the standard pen tool. It doesn't matter how tidy or messy it is, what matters if <i>you, yourself</i> is able to understand it."><img src="images/gallery/stepbystep/juudai/1_thumb.jpg"></a>
                        <a class="image-set" href="images/gallery/stepbystep/juudai/2.jpg" data-lightbox="juudai" data-title="Line <br>After the sketch comes the line art; my line arts tend to remain quite closely the same to my sketch. Sometimes I do fix up a few things that looked a bit off in my sketch, but most of the time I stay true to it. I also use the standard pen tool for line arting. Another thing that's effective in line art, is being able to apply different weights in different areas in the lines. (Some areas are thicker, some are thinner etc.)"><img src="images/gallery/stepbystep/juudai/2_thumb.jpg"></a>
                        <a class="image-set" href="images/gallery/stepbystep/juudai/3.jpg" data-lightbox="juudai" data-title="Fill <br>Afterwards, I fill the inner part of the line art with a grey colour; this helps so that when I move onto the next step of base colouring, I will be able to colour the whole image without missing small spots. The grey layer can also help the artist to see if any colours have gone outside of the line art as well. I use the selection/magic wand tool for this step."><img src="images/gallery/stepbystep/juudai/3_thumb.jpg"></a>

A mix of cel shading and some soft shade, I wanted to try to use different shaded colours than usual. For example, with base colour black, you'd typically shade it with a darker black. In this drawing, I chose to use alternative colours than just the typical darker shade for shading. Same goes with lighting too. For the shading/shines on Juudai (the character) I used the pen tool, eraser tool and marker tool."><img src="images/gallery/stepbystep/juudai/5_thumb.jpg"></a>

In Paint Tool SAI, they have different options they give effects to the layer. (Such as Overlay, Multiply, Lumi & Shade, Binary, Screen etc.) This is convenient for lighting/shading effects, so I've used the 'Shade' option on a new layer and chosen a darker colour to shade on top of Juudai. Then, I used the blur tool smooth out the darker colour to look a bit more natural. Next, on areas where I thought there should be more light, I used the 'Luminosity' option to create a bright glowy effect on the lighter areas."><img src="images/gallery/stepbystep/juudai/7_thumb.jpg"></a>

In step-by-steps, I don't usually show this part but I decided to do it this time, just to show the very first thing that I do right after I open a new canvas.

This was done using the pen tool."><img src="images/gallery/stepbystep/toraishi/1_thumb.jpg"></a>

        <div class="container ditr-body">
            <p>Being a past traditional artist and now a current digital artist, I must say that I'm impressed my sister and I have come this far. At first, we <i>only</i> drew traditionally (with pencil/pen on paper) as we refused to work with a drawing tablet. Despite having a good quality tablet collecting dust (Wacom Intuos4 X), we constantly told ourselves that we were satisfied with traditional art, that we didn't need to start digital art, and that it was 'too hard to learn to use the drawing tablet'. However, over the years we grew tired of only drawing traditionally. We didn't want to stick with pen and paper forever, so we managed to gather up the motivation to hunt down a good drawing program (Paint Tool SAI) and wiped the dust off the unused Wacom tablet. And we were right, it was hard getting used to drawing digitally; not only that, but it wasn't until 2 years later after digitally drawing that we discovered pen sensitivity pressure on our tablet! (We were going nuts about it ahaha) Thanks to that, our drawings got 100% better and it became really easy to use the tablet. Now, we do all of our drawings straight on to SAI, but on the rare occassion, we will draw traditionally first and then scan the image on to the pc.
                <br><u>tl;dr - We decided to switch to digital from traditional and kept it that way.</u>
                <br>
                <br> Below are comparisons between Mikoto's traditional and digital art pieces.
                <br><u>Traditional</u> - My traditional art tends to be rather scribbly and messy. I don't bother using the eraser too much to avoid smudging the lead. Also, when I draw traditionally I tend to have my anatomy proportions slightly off. I always say that the problem with traditional art is that there's no "Ctrl+Z" button~
                <br><u>Digital</u> - In my opinion, my digital art is always 100% better than my traditional; hence why I stick with it now. Digital is much easier for me, and it's always way more visually appealing to look at. I can play around with the colours and brushes as I like; I feel I have more freedom when I draw digitally in comparison to a pen & paper.

I wanted to try to get used to drawing backgrounds more often as usually I don't draw scenery; I feel like my backgrounds are more amateur-ish compared to the characters ahaha. I was playing around with different brushes for the colouring...ah, I need to practice drawing backgrounds more."><img src="images/gallery/boueibu/binanshi_jan_thumb.jpg"></a>
                        <a class="image-right" href="images/gallery/fanart/kaidachu.jpg" data-lightbox="kaidachu" data-title="Sketch of Zon <br>Even my sketches look better on digital then traditional! My favourite part of drawing is sketching as it can be as messy as I like without a care in the world. Although I call this piece of work a sketch, in reality it's a lot neater than my usual sketches, haha."><img src="images/gallery/fanart/kaidachu_thumb.jpg"></a>
                        <a class="image-right" href="images/gallery/oc/luminescence.jpg" data-lightbox="kohaku" data-title="Luminescence <br>One of my prized pieces of work that I take great pride in. This was definitely one of my best works from late 2015. I tried to attempt the whole background lighting effect. I also experimented with the water ripples at their feet, and that was fun to do, especially with their reflections. Drawing their flowing jackets was also a treat for me. Being able to contrast the reds with the pale blues was a really nice thing for me to attempt."><img src="images/gallery/oc/luminescence_thumb.jpg"></a>

Drawing this digitally certainly allowed me to work faster than traditional. I tried to keep this work relatively simple and the line art is actually a bit messy as it was just a sketch but cleaned up a bit. I tried 'cel shading' most of it and it was also my first time trying a focus blur effect."><img src="images/gallery/ygo/asuka_arcv_thumb.jpg"></a>
                        <a class="image-right" href="images/gallery/ygo/shark.jpg" data-lightbox="shark" data-title="SHAKYUU <br>The vivid blue background along with floating bubbles rally brings out the character's eyes in this art piece. I'm really proud of this drawing as I wanted to make this character (his nickname is 'Shark') look attractive. (laughs) Other than trying to make him attractive, at the time I was drawing this I was quite pressured under time. The shading in Shark's hair and eyes is what I like best in this drawing (other than the quick yet effective background)."><img src="images/gallery/ygo/shark_thumb.jpg"></a>

                <br>These days memes aren't all about humour; there are various art memes around too. Especially on art-based websites such as deviantArt, there are many different types of art memes for either improvement, challenge, or sheer entertainment.

            <a class="image-set" href="images/gallery/akane.png" data-lightbox="akane" data-title="MS Paint Challenge Meme: Winged Kuriboh & Akane <br>The MS Paint Challenge Meme really was a challenge. I had to use a program I was not familiar with (in terms of drawing) and it was really basic; so basic that it was actually quite limiting. <br>First, I did a messy sketch of Akane (the boy) and then coloured over it. After the colouring and shading, I had to line art <i>over</i> the colour, however because MS Paint doesn't carry on the same pen sensitivity pressure settings as Paint Tool SAI, it made my lines look quite wobbly. This is unusual of me, as I usually do line art first, and then colour <i>underneath</i> the line art. <br>The Winged Kuriboh on the left was just me playing around with MS Paint's brushes."><img src="images/gallery/akane_thumb.png"></a>
            <a class="image-set" href="images/gallery/pen_challenge1.jpg" data-lightbox="pc1" data-title="Pen Challenge Meme no.1 of Masumi Kotsu <br>The Pen Challenge Meme was fun but a little difficult as you had to use a pen straight onto the paper, without being allowed to use an eraser to fix your mistakes. Usually, I would draw in pencil first, then line over my pencil drawing with pen; but starting with pen first was a mission. The Pen Challenge Meme wasn't only to show off your traditional skills but it was to also see the artist's handwriting."><img src="images/gallery/pen_challenge1_thumb.jpg"></a>

            <a class="image-set" href="images/gallery/setsuna_compare1.jpg" data-lightbox="setsuna-1" data-title="Tsukumo Setsuna Draw this again Meme 1 <br>There is an actual 'Draw this again Meme' template but for two reasons I decided not to use it. One, I couldn't be bothered finding it, then cropping the image to the correct size; Two, I honestly don't think the original template looked aesthetically pleasing. So, I decided to just do it myself - threw on the images and wrote in 'Before VS After' myself."><img src="images/gallery/setsuna_compare1_thumb.jpg"></a>

Being able to see the comparison shows that you've improved, and it's quite refreshing to see the change in style/colour/design compared to the old image. <br>These drawings are of an original character of mine; the 'before' is from 2014, while the 'after' is from this year's 2016."><img src="images/gallery/setsuna_compare2_thumb.jpg"></a>

It's fascinating to see how different and unique each eye style can be~"><img src="images/gallery/eyes_thumb.jpg"></a>
